# This configuration file defines the default llm instance
# to be used in the agent system.
#
# The 'default_llm' key under the [DEFAULT] section specifies the name of
# the default LLM instance. This value is utilized when the agent applies an
# LLM but no specific model is manually designated. In such cases, the system
# will fall back to the model instance specified here.
#
# For example, if 'default_llm' is set to 'qwen2.5-72b-instruct', the agent will use the
# 'qwen2.5-72b-instruct' model instance as the default unless explicitly overridden by user configuration.
